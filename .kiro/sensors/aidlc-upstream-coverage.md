# upstream-coverage sensor

Reads the stage frontmatter `consumes:` list and checks the output prose
references each upstream artifact (by name or wikilink).

Pure derivation from frontmatter — no per-stage config needed.

## Failure mode

Emits `SENSOR_FAILED` and writes detail listing artifacts declared in
`consumes:` that don't appear anywhere in the output prose.
