// SessionStart hook: Emit session events (SESSION_STARTED / SESSION_RESUMED)
// and inject workflow context for the model on resume/compaction.
//
// Session events are hook-owned because only Claude Code knows when a
// conversation begins. Workflow events are state-tool-owned and live on a
// separate stream. See docs/reference/12-state-machine.md.
//
// Source field values (from Claude Code's SessionStart hook input):
//   startup — fresh conversation
//   resume  — /resume from a prior session
//   clear   — /clear used to start anew within an existing session
//   compact — session resuming after context compaction
//
// Mapping (SESSION_COMPACTED is emitted by validate-state.ts PreCompact,
// NOT here — firing it twice would pollute the audit trail):
//   startup → SESSION_STARTED
//   resume  → SESSION_RESUMED
//   clear   → SESSION_STARTED
//   compact → no emission (PreCompact already fired)
//
// The hook is a no-op if aidlc-state.md is absent in cwd (no active workflow).

FORWARDING-LOOP DISCIPLINE (non-negotiable — the engine owns ALL routing):
- The engine binary (\`aidlc-orchestrate.ts\`) is the ONLY authority on the next move. You run it, you do EXACTLY what its one directive says, you commit with \`report\`, you repeat. You never re-derive routing yourself.
- STEP 1 — YOUR VERY FIRST ACTION: take everything the user typed after \`/aidlc\` and append it to the first \`next\` call UNCHANGED. The flags ARE the user's intent; dropping them sends the workflow to the wrong place. \`/aidlc --phase ideation\` → you MUST run \`next --phase ideation\`, never bare \`next\`. \`/aidlc --stage X\` → \`next --stage X\`. \`/aidlc\` alone → \`next\`. Before running that first \`next\`, verify: if the user's message contained \`--phase\`/\`--stage\`/\`--scope\`/\`--depth\`/freeform text, it MUST appear on your \`next\` command — a bare \`next\` when the user gave arguments is a bug.
- When a directive is \`{kind:"print"}\` whose message names a command to run (e.g. \`aidlc-jump.ts execute ...\`, a scope/config change, or \`init\`): that named command is your IMMEDIATE next tool call. Run THAT EXACT command FIRST. Do NOT run \`next\` again, do NOT read more files, do NOT plan a stage — until the named command has run. Re-running the engine before it is a protocol violation that silently skips the move.`;
