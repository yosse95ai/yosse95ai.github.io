// The runner-skill generator — one tool, two runner families.
//
// (1) STAGE-RUNNERS: one thin `skills/aidlc-<stage>/SKILL.md`
//     per RUNNABLE compiled stage slug. A stage-runner is OPT-IN SUGAR: it
//     packages `/aidlc --stage <slug> --single`, which works without it, into a
//     typeable `/aidlc-<stage>` command. The authoritative authoring path is
//     "write a stage file"; this generator bakes a runner shell over the
//     compiled graph so the set of runners can never drift from the set of
//     stages by hand. The bootstrap INITIALIZATION stages are excluded (they
//     have no standalone --single meaning); the whole init phase is packaged as
//     ONE `/aidlc-init` runner over `/aidlc --init` instead.
//
// (2) SCOPE-RUNNERS: one thin `skills/aidlc-<scope>/SKILL.md` per
//     shipped `.claude/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` file. A scope-runner is packaging,
//     not definition (decision D-A): each is a ~6-line shell that drives the
//     engine (`aidlc-orchestrate next --scope <scope>`) to `done` with a fixed
//     scope and no scope detection. The full set of scopes is always reachable
//     via `/aidlc --scope <name>`; runners are typeable sugar over the
//     high-traffic ones (the FIRST_BATCH).
//
// COMPOSE, don't reimplement. The stage-slug list comes from loadGraph() — the
// one compiled source of truth (data/stage-graph.json); the scope list comes
// from the shipped `.claude/scopes/*.md` files. A stage added to the graph (or a
// scope file dropped in) flows into a runner with no edit here, and the drift
// guards (`check` for stages — t129; `scopes --check` for scopes — t130) fail CI
// if the on-disk set ever diverges from the source-of-truth set.
//
// NO HOOKS in any runner (Fork 2→B, settled): the six skill-scoped hooks live
// project-wide in settings.json, so a runner carries no `hooks:` block to
// replicate or drift-guard — the deterministic spine is inherited, not copied.
//
// The conductor persona is delivered by the ENGINE on the first `next` (decision
// D-E, SPIKE 6) — baked into the run-stage directive — so the runner body does
// NOT load conductor.md by hand.
//
// Subcommands:
//   write            — (re)generate every STAGE-runner dir from the compiled
//                      stage list.
//   check            — STAGE-runner drift guard: exit 0 iff the on-disk runner
//                      set == the compiled stage-slug set (no missing, no
//                      orphan); exit 1 with a diff on stdout otherwise.
//   list             — print the stage slugs one per line (debugging aid).
//   scopes [--all] [--check] [--out <skills-dir>]
//                    — generate/validate SCOPE-runner skills over
//                      `.claude/scopes/*.md` (FIRST_BATCH, or `--all`).
//
// Env seams (mirror aidlc-lib.ts): AIDLC_SCOPES_DIR points the scope-file reader
// at an isolated tree; --out points the scope writer at an isolated skills dir.

# AI-DLC Stage Runner — ${node.slug}

Run the \`${node.slug}\` stage on its own. This is opt-in packaging over
\`/aidlc --stage ${node.slug} --single\`; the same stage is always reachable via
that flag without this skill.

## Steps

1. Ask the engine for the single-stage directive:

   \`\`\`bash
   bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --stage ${node.slug} --single
   \`\`\`

   The engine emits one \`run-stage\` directive for \`${node.slug}\` (carrying the
   lead agent, the resolved consumes/produces paths, the rules and sensors in
   context, and — on this first directive — the conductor persona). Run the stage
   exactly as the directive describes; do not load the conductor persona by hand,
   the engine delivers it.

2. When the stage's work is done, commit the single-stage record:

   \`\`\`bash
   bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --single --stage ${node.slug} --result completed
   \`\`\`

   This records a STAGE_STARTED / STAGE_COMPLETED pair under a synthetic workflow
   id and stops. It NEVER writes the main workflow's \`Current Stage\` — a
   single-stage run is isolated by design (the tool refuses to advance the main
   workflow).
`;
}

// Render the `/aidlc-init` runner: a thin wrapper over the deterministic
// `intent-birth` move (which runs the whole initialization phase — mint the
// intent + detect the workspace + build state — in one call). This is the
// init-phase analogue of the per-stage runners: opt-in packaging over a path
// the engine already names at birth. It drives `intent-birth`, NOT
// `--stage … --single`, so the stage-runner drift guard (which keys on the
// `--stage`+`--single` marker) never counts it. There is no user-facing
// `/aidlc --init` (P4): the workspace shell ships in dist/ and the engine
// auto-births the first intent — this runner just makes that explicit.

# AI-DLC — start a workflow (birth the first intent)

Start a fresh AI-DLC workflow. The workspace shell ships in \`dist/\` (no setup
command), and the engine auto-births the first intent when you describe what to
build — this skill is opt-in packaging over that birth move. Initialization is a
PHASE, not a single stage — it mints the intent, detects the workspace
(greenfield/brownfield), and builds \`aidlc-state.md\` together, in one
deterministic call. There is no per-init-stage runner because an init stage has
no standalone meaning.

## Steps

1. Birth the intent (run the initialization phase). Parse the user's
   \`$ARGUMENTS\`: forward any recognized flags
   (\`--scope <name>\`/\`--depth <level>\`/\`--test-strategy <level>\`/\`--test-run\`)
   as-is, and pass any freeform description text via \`--arguments "<text>"\`
   (\`intent-birth\` reads the description from the \`--arguments\` flag, NOT a
   positional — forwarding it bare would silently drop it). ALSO derive a short
   **\`--label\`**: a 2-3 word kebab-case essence of what's being built
   (\`"I would like to build a simple calculator application"\` → \`--label
   "simple calc"\`). The label becomes the readable, date-prefixed record dir name
   (\`<YYMMDD>-simple-calc\`); the full \`--arguments\` text is preserved separately
   in the audit + state. Omit \`--label\` only when there is no description (the
   tool then falls back to the scope token):

   \`\`\`bash
   bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-birth --scope <name> --arguments "<description>" --label "<2-3 word essence>"
   \`\`\`

   \`--scope\` seeds the initial scope (defaults to \`poc\`); omit \`--arguments\`
   and \`--label\` when the user gave no description. Print the tool's output and
   stop. This does not advance a stage; run \`/aidlc\` afterwards to continue.

// Write (or refresh) every stage-runner dir from the RUNNABLE stage list (init
// stages excluded — see isRunnableStage), plus the single `/aidlc-init` phase

# AI-DLC — ${scope} scope

Drive the AI-DLC engine with the **${scope}** scope fixed. This is the same
deterministic forwarding loop the \`/aidlc\` orchestrator runs, with \`--scope
${scope}\` baked into the first \`next\` so scope detection is skipped. The
engine owns all routing; the conductor persona arrives on the first directive's
\`conductor_persona\` field — adopt it for the whole run.

## The loop

1. \`directive = bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --scope ${scope} $ARGUMENTS\`
2. Act on \`directive.kind\` exactly as the orchestrator does (run-stage / ask / print / error / done) — see \`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md\`.
3. \`bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <directive.stage> --result <outcome> [--user-input "<text>"]\` when the directive names a stage; omit \`--stage\` only for non-stage report round-trips.
4. Repeat from step 1 until \`directive.kind == done\`.

Pass \`$ARGUMENTS\` through verbatim after \`--scope ${scope}\`; the engine parses
any flags (\`--status\`, \`--stage\`, \`--test-run\`, …) and the \`--scope\` from the
state file always wins on an existing workflow, so re-running a started workflow
resumes it. To run a different scope, use \`/aidlc --scope <other>\` instead.
