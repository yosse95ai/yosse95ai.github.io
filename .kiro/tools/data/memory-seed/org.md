# Org-Level Rules

## Way of Working

We use **trunk-based development**. All work merges to `main` via
short-lived feature branches (typically resolved within 1-2 days).
Long-lived branches accumulate merge debt; we avoid them.

For Construction worktrees, the worktree base branch is `main` and the
merge target is `main`.

If our project requires multiple environments (staging, production), we
still keep one trunk and gate releases via tags or environment-specific
deployment configs — not via long-lived release branches.

We **squash-merge** Bolt branches into `main`. Each Bolt becomes one
commit on the trunk, named by the Bolt slug, with the full Bolt commit
history preserved on the source branch until the worktree is discarded.

Squash gives us a clean linear `main` history that maps 1:1 to
delivery-planning's Bolt sequence. We accept the trade-off of losing
intermediate commits on `main` because the audit log preserves the full
event sequence anyway.

## Walking Skeleton

We always run the walking-skeleton Bolt **first** when our scope is
greenfield (`mvp`, `enterprise`, `feature`, `poc`, `workshop`, `infra`).
Bolt 1 is solo, gated, and the user explicitly approves before remaining
Bolts run.

We **skip the skeleton ceremony** when our scope is incremental work on
an existing codebase (`bugfix`, `refactor`, `security-patch`). The first
Bolt runs like any other — there's nothing to bootstrap.

After Bolt 1 ships (when it runs), the orchestrator fires the **ladder
prompt**: "How should the remaining Bolts run?" Options: continue
autonomously, gate every Bolt. The team picks per project. The choice
persists as `Construction Autonomy Mode` in `aidlc-state.md`.

## Testing Posture

We treat tests as a first-class deliverable in every Bolt. Specific
methodology — TDD, BDD, ATDD, or classic test-after — is captured by the
testing-strategy stage when it ships.

Until then, our default per scope is:
- `mvp`, `enterprise`, `feature`, `infra` → tests written alongside
  code; minimum 80% line coverage; tests run in CI before merge.
- `bugfix`, `security-patch` → regression test for the specific
  bug/vulnerability; existing test suite must remain green.
- `poc`, `refactor`, `workshop` → existing test suite remains green;
  no new test floor required.

Override at `aidlc-team.md` if the team commits to a stricter posture.

## Deployment

We **deploy on merge** to staging environments. Production deploys gate
on a separate manual approval — typically tech lead + product owner
sign-off in CodePipeline or a CD platform's environment protection.

Teams that have invested in test coverage and observability sometimes
graduate to continuous deployment to production (every commit
auto-deploys); that's a team decision, not a framework default.

## Code Style

We defer to project-level configurations:
- Formatter: Prettier (JS/TS), Black (Python), `gofmt` (Go), or
  language-default. Configured in repo root (`.prettierrc`,
  `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
- Linter: ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint, etc. Run in CI before merge;
  failure blocks the PR.
- Naming conventions: language idiomatic (camelCase for JS/TS,
  snake_case for Python, etc.). No project-wide rename rules unless
  team affirms one.

When the framework makes a code-style suggestion, agents read the
project's linter config first; the agent's suggestion only fires if the
linter doesn't already cover it.

## Forbidden

<!-- Things agents must never do -->
<!-- Example: Do not ask questions about topics already decided in previous stages -->

## Mandated

<!-- Things agents must always do -->
<!-- Example: All architecture decisions must include an ADR -->

## Corrections

<!-- Self-learning loop appends here. -->
<!-- Use aidlc-team.md to record team-wide overrides; aidlc-project.md
     to record project-specific deviations. The loaders merge org → team
     → project at session start; each layer replaces fields the layer
     above set; missing fields fall through. -->
