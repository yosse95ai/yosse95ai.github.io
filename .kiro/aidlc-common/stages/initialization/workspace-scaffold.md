# Workspace Scaffold

Runs deterministically inside `aidlc-utility intent-birth`. The workspace shell ships in `dist/` (the SEED); birth only ensure-exists the per-intent record and artifact dirs (creates them on demand, idempotent). Kept as reference for audit event semantics.

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for state tracking and audit logging.

## Steps

### Step 1: Update State

1. Update `<record>/aidlc-state.md`: set `Current Stage` to `scaffolding workspace`
2. Mark workspace-scaffold as `[-]` in progress

### Step 2: Ensure the Space Knowledge Directory

Ensure-exists the space-level domain-knowledge directory
`aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/` (shorthand `aidlc/knowledge/`). It is
**free-form and empty at bootstrap** — no fixed file set, no per-agent
subdirectories, no seeded READMEs. A team adds its own markdown here over time;
the directory is a sibling of `memory/`, `codekb/`, and `intents/`, so domain
knowledge accumulates across every intent in the space rather than being trapped
in one intent's record. The agent personas read team knowledge from
`aidlc/knowledge/aidlc-shared/` and `aidlc/knowledge/<agent>/` if those exist —
the team creates them; birth does not. (The engine's per-agent METHODOLOGY
knowledge ships separately and read-only under `.kiro/knowledge/`.)

### Step 3: Ensure Stage Artifact Directories

Ensure-exists the empty per-intent stage artifact directories under the active
intent's record dir `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/` (no READMEs) —
idempotent (created on demand):

- `<record>/initialization/` — workspace-scaffold/, workspace-detection/, state-init/
- `<record>/ideation/` — intent-capture/, market-research/, feasibility/, scope-definition/, team-formation/, rough-mockups/, approval-handoff/
- `<record>/inception/` — reverse-engineering/, requirements-analysis/, user-stories/, refined-mockups/, application-design/, units-generation/, delivery-planning/
- `<record>/construction/` — build-and-test/, ci-pipeline/
- `<record>/operation/` — deployment-pipeline/, environment-provisioning/, deployment-execution/, observability-setup/, incident-response/, performance-validation/, feedback-optimization/
- `<record>/verification/`

### Step 4: Display Confirmation

List the created directory structure for user awareness.

### Step 5: Update State and Audit

1. Mark workspace-scaffold as `[x]` completed in `<record>/aidlc-state.md`
2. Append WORKSPACE_SCAFFOLDED event to `<record>/audit/<host>-<clone>.md`

### Step 6: Auto-Proceed

This stage has NO approval gate — it auto-proceeds to the next stage (workspace-detection).

## Sensors

This stage runs deterministic setup logic inside `aidlc-utility intent-birth` —
it ensure-exists the per-intent record and artifact dirs and emits state events. No
agent-authored markdown lands here, so the frontmatter `sensors:` list
is empty.

If a fork later customises this stage to write markdown reports, import
the relevant manifests via `sensors:` in this file's frontmatter; the
resolver will populate `sensors_applicable` at the next compile.

## Learn

While running this stage, maintain a running log in
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` (create on stage start if absent).
Append entries under four standard headings:

- **Interpretations** — choices made where the stage prose was ambiguous
- **Deviations** — places you intentionally departed from the stage prose, and why
- **Tradeoffs** — alternatives considered and why you picked what you did
- **Open questions** — anything to confirm before next run, or uncertain context

Format each entry with an ISO 8601 timestamp:
`- 2026-05-20T10:14:32Z — <summary>; <context>`

Before the approval gate, read memory.md and surface candidates as a
structured question. For each entry the user keeps, write to the appropriate
harness destination per `stage-protocol.md` §13 — never to this stage file:

- Prescriptive rule → `.kiro/steering/aidlc-phase-<phase>.md` (phase-scoped)
  or `.kiro/steering/aidlc-<org|team|project>.md` (cross-cutting)
- Verification check → new manifest at `.kiro/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md`
  (capability descriptor only — no `applies_to`); add the new id to
  the relevant stage's `sensors: [...]` frontmatter list to wire it

If nothing surfaces or the user skips all, proceed to the gate. The memory.md
file stays in the artefact directory as part of the stage's permanent record.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file. Next time this stage runs, the new rules and
sensors load automatically.
