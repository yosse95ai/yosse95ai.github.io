# State Initialization

Runs deterministically inside `aidlc-utility init`. Kept as reference for state-file contract.

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for state tracking and audit logging.

## Steps

### Step 1: Update State

1. Update `<record>/aidlc-state.md`: set `Current Stage` to `initializing state`
2. Mark state-init as `[-]` in progress

### Step 2: Create Full State File

Read the state template from `.kiro/knowledge/aidlc-shared/state-template.md`.
Overwrite `<record>/aidlc-state.md` with the full populated version:
- Project description (from orchestrator's $ARGUMENTS or `<record>/audit/<host>-<clone>.md`)
- Project type (greenfield/brownfield from workspace-detection)
- Workspace state (languages, frameworks, build system from workspace-detection)
- Start date — run `date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'` via Bash
- Scope configuration (stages to execute/skip per scope routing)
- Full stage progress checkboxes (all stages, with INITIALIZATION stages marked [x] for workspace-scaffold, workspace-detection)
- Mark state-init as `[-]` in progress
- Total Stages: count EXECUTE stages only (not SKIP). Authoritative counts come from the compiled scope grid (`.kiro/tools/data/scope-grid.json`, transposed from each stage's `scopes:` frontmatter; run `bun .kiro/tools/aidlc-utility.ts scope-table` for the live table). Today's values:
  | Scope | EXECUTE / Total |
  |-------|-----------------|
  | enterprise / feature | 31 / 31 |
  | mvp | 21 / 31 |
  | poc | 8 / 31 |
  | bugfix | 7 / 31 |
  | refactor | 8 / 31 |
  | infra | 12 / 31 |
  | security-patch | 9 / 31 |
  | workshop | 24 / 31 |
- Completed: set to number of completed INITIALIZATION stages (typically 3)
- In Progress: set to first post-initialization stage name
- Active Agent: set to lead agent of the first post-initialization stage (from Stage Graph)

### Step 3: Determine Routing

Based on project type:
- **Brownfield** → First post-initialization stage: reverse-engineering (Inception)
- **Greenfield** → First post-initialization stage: requirements-analysis (Inception), skip reverse-engineering

Update aidlc-state.md with the routing decision:
- Set `Stages to Execute` and `Stages to Skip` based on scope + project type
- Mark reverse-engineering as SKIP for greenfield projects

### Step 4: Finalize State

**If invoked from `--init`:**
- Set Lifecycle Phase to READY
- Set Current Stage to `workspace initialized — run /aidlc [scope] to start`
- Do NOT continue to the Ideation phase

**If invoked from workflow start:**
- Set Lifecycle Phase to the first post-initialization phase (IDEATION or INCEPTION depending on scope)
- Set Current Stage to the first post-initialization stage

### Step 5: Update State and Audit

1. Mark state-init as `[x]` completed in `<record>/aidlc-state.md`
2. Append WORKSPACE_INITIALISED event to `<record>/audit/<host>-<clone>.md` with project type and tech stack summary

### Step 6: Auto-Proceed

This stage has NO approval gate — it auto-proceeds to the first post-initialization stage (or stops if invoked from --init).

## Sensors

This stage writes `<record>/aidlc-state.md` deterministically through
`aidlc-state.ts`. The state file is a structured manifest, not the kind
of free-form artefact the markdown-shape sensors target — so the
frontmatter `sensors:` list is empty.

A future check that validates state-file shape (heading set, required
fields) would land as its own manifest, imported here via `sensors:`.

## Learn

While running this stage, maintain a running log in
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` (create on stage start if absent).
Append entries under four standard headings:

- **Interpretations** — choices made where the stage prose was ambiguous
- **Deviations** — places you intentionally departed from the stage prose, and why
- **Tradeoffs** — alternatives considered and why you picked what you did
- **Open questions** — anything to confirm before next run, or uncertain context

Format each entry with an ISO 8601 timestamp:
`- 2026-05-20T10:14:32Z — <summary>; <context>`

Before the approval gate, read memory.md and surface candidates as a
structured question. For each entry the user keeps, write to the appropriate
harness destination per `stage-protocol.md` §13 — never to this stage file:

- Prescriptive rule → `.kiro/steering/aidlc-phase-<phase>.md` (phase-scoped)
  or `.kiro/steering/aidlc-<org|team|project>.md` (cross-cutting)
- Verification check → new manifest at `.kiro/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md`
  (capability descriptor only — no `applies_to`); add the new id to
  the relevant stage's `sensors: [...]` frontmatter list to wire it

If nothing surfaces or the user skips all, proceed to the gate. The memory.md
file stays in the artefact directory as part of the stage's permanent record.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file. Next time this stage runs, the new rules and
sensors load automatically.
