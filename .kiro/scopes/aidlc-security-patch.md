# security-patch scope

Minimal depth for responding to a CVE or vulnerability fast. It threads a
narrow path: understand the code (reverse-engineering), capture the
security requirement (nfr-requirements), fix and test (code-generation,
build-and-test), then ship through the deployment stages so the patch
actually reaches production.

## Why these stages, why skip those

A security patch is urgent, incremental, and must deploy. It skips the
whole discovery and design ceremony (ideation, application-design,
units-generation, nfr-design, infrastructure-design) because the change is
targeted, but unlike `bugfix` it keeps deployment-pipeline and
deployment-execution EXECUTE — a patch that never deploys does not close
the vulnerability. nfr-requirements runs so the security constraint is
recorded. One of the three incremental scopes that skip the
walking-skeleton ceremony.

## Membership

Keyword triggers: `security`, `CVE`, `vulnerability`, `patch`.
Initialization, reverse-engineering, nfr-requirements, code-generation,
build-and-test, deployment-pipeline, and deployment-execution execute; the
rest is SKIP.
