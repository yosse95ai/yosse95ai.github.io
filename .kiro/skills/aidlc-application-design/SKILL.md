# AI-DLC Stage Runner — application-design

Run the `application-design` stage on its own. This is opt-in packaging over
`/aidlc --stage application-design --single`; the same stage is always reachable via
that flag without this skill.

## Steps

1. Ask the engine for the single-stage directive:

   ```bash
   bun .kiro/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --stage application-design --single
   ```

   The engine emits one `run-stage` directive for `application-design` (carrying the
   lead agent, the resolved consumes/produces paths, the rules and sensors in
   context, and — on this first directive — the conductor persona). Run the stage
   exactly as the directive describes; do not load the conductor persona by hand,
   the engine delivers it.

2. When the stage's work is done, commit the single-stage record:

   ```bash
   bun .kiro/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --single --stage application-design --result completed
   ```

   This records a STAGE_STARTED / STAGE_COMPLETED pair under a synthetic workflow
   id and stops. It NEVER writes the main workflow's `Current Stage` — a
   single-stage run is isolated by design (the tool refuses to advance the main
   workflow).
