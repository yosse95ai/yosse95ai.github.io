# Question Rendering — Kiro CLI harness annex

This file defines how THIS harness renders the structured questions that
`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md` § "Structured questions" requires.
The protocol and stage files are harness-neutral: they say *present a
structured question* and carry a fenced ` ```question ` spec block. This annex
is the one place that binds that contract to a concrete mechanism.

## Mechanism

Kiro CLI has no structured-question tool, so every structured question renders
as **numbered prose options in chat**, and the user answers with a number (or
free text). Render the spec like this:

```question
prompt: "[Stage Name] complete. How would you like to proceed?"
header: Approval
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: Approve
    description: Continue to [next stage]
  - label: Request Changes
    description: Provide revision feedback
```

becomes:

```
**Approval** — [Stage Name] complete. How would you like to proceed?

1. **Approve** — Continue to [next stage]
2. **Request Changes** — Provide revision feedback
3. **Other** — describe what you want instead

Reply with a number (or just tell me).
```

Rules:

- **Bold the header**, then the prompt, then the numbered options in spec
  order. When a question has a recommended option, list it FIRST and append
  "(Recommended)" to its label.
- **Always append an "Other" escape** as the final number — the spec's
  options never include one (on Claude Code the UI provides it; here you
  render it).
- **multiSelect: true** → say "Reply with all numbers that apply (e.g. 1, 3)."
- **Answer capture**: map the user's number back to the exact option `label`
  and record that label verbatim (protocol: never summarize User Input). A
  free-text reply that clearly matches an option counts as that option;
  anything else is an "Other" answer — treat it per the protocol (discuss,
  then re-ask for a final pick).
- **Batching**: no harness limit on options per question, but keep batches
  readable — at most ~4 questions per message, and for 5+ options prefer one
  message per question. The questions FILE remains the authoritative record.
- **No emergent options**: render exactly the spec's options (+ Other). The
  NO EMERGENT BEHAVIOR rule applies to the rendering, not just the spec.
